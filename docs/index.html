<blockquote><p>Looking for the <a href="//omnidata.vision/#paper">research paper</a> or the <a href="//omnidata.vision">main website</a>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is wiki/documentation site for everything that we're open-sourcing from the paper. (Check out the main site for an overview of 'steerable datastes' and the 3D -&gt; 2D rendering pipeline). This website is the next step for getting started with the annotator, downloading the starter datset, releasing your own dataset, or using some of the pretrained models from the paper. As well as links to GitHub repositories, this site contains usage examples, demos and documentation.</p>
<p>Ideally, this site is supposed to be about half-code and half-wiki.</p>
